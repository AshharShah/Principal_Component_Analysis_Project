# CEP Project, Satellite Image Processing

This is a project i recieved in my 5th Semester at the University. It deals with image processing, specifically processing and analyzing satellite images(Landstat).

- Firstly we analyze the bands of the orignal satellite image and then merge them into a single image using earthpy library to form a colored image from all the bands. Then we apply basic operations on the image such as scaling the image.
